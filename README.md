## Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core)
 
### Conceptual Understanding
 
- **Onion Architecture:** No
- **MVC Pattern:** Yes
- **Web API:** No
### Application & Bottlenecks
### Onion Architecture
 
- **Benefits:** Improved Developer Experience, Scalability, and Testability
- **Bottlenecks (Encountered):** Yes, because the Onion Architecture faces a learning curve for developers unfamiliar with the pattern, requiring a deep understanding of software design principles and additional time for effective implementation. Enforcing architectural boundaries can increase complexity.
 
### MVC
- **Components**
- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application. It manages the data, logic, and rules of the application's domain.
- **View:** Represents the presentation layer, responsible for rendering the user interface based on the data from the model. It presents information to the user and captures user interactions.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and view. It handles user input, updates the model based on that input, and selects the appropriate view to present the updated data to the user.
 
- **Bottlenecks (Encountered):** No, since I'm currently getting to know all of these MVC components.
 
### Web API
 
- **Differences from MVC:** Traditional MVC applications are primarily designed for rendering HTML views in a web browser. They consist of Models, Views, and Controllers, where the controller handles user input, interacts with the model, and determines the view to be displayed. On the other hand, Web APIs are designed for exchanging data between clients and servers, typically in JSON or XML format. They provide endpoints that allow clients to request and manipulate data, making them ideal for building backend services, mobile applications, or single-page applications.
- **Bottlenecks (Encountered):** No, since I'm currently getting to know all of these MVC components.
